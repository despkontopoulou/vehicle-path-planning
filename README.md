Dissertation project- Path planning for vehicles - Java and Spring Boot web app

## Deployment Steps:
In order for the backend to run, we need to import data from OSM.
Download the latest osm.pbf file for Greece and place it in the resource directory with this name and path from content root:
src/main/resources/maps/greece-latest.osm.pbf. You can find the latest pbf file here:
https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/greece.html

After running the backend successfully, you can start up the frontend.
Navigate to /frontend and run "npm start".
Then you are ready to go!
